                    <p>Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, originally published
                        as two separate serials (1963-64 novel 'Dune World' and 1965 novel 'Prophet of Dune') in Analog
                        magazine. It is one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of
                        Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult
                        and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a
                        film based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a
                        constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to
                        mostly negative responses from critics and failure at the box office, although it later
                        developed a cult following. The book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi
                        Channel miniseries Frank's Herbert’s Dune and its 2003 sequel, Frank's Herbert’s Children of
                        Dune A second film adaptation, directed by Denis Villeneuve, was released on October 21, 2021,
                        to positive reviews. It grossed $434 million worldwide and went on to be nominated for
                        ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture, ultimately winning six. Villeneuve's film covers
                        roughly the first half of the original novel; a sequel, which covers the second half of the
                        story, was released on March 1, 2024, to critical acclaim.</p>

                <div class="info-sinopsis">
                    <p>First part of the Film Adaptation of Dune (1965) by Frank Herbert, directed by the Oscar
                        Nominated Filmmaker Denis Villeneuve. It follows the story of the House Atreides. In the year
                        10191, the noble houses dispute the domain of the planet Arrakis, the only place of the universe
                        that the ‘spice’ can be found, the most wanted and valuable row material of the universe that is
                        produced by titanic sized Sandworms, it is necessary to make possible the interestellar travel
                        and it is also a drug able to amplify the human consciousness and extend the human life. Because
                        of this and its risky extraction the ones who control the ‘spice’ production doesn’t control
                        just the destiny of the empire, but of the whole humanity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) will accept the administration of this dangerous planet and will
                        be sent to Arrakis by the Emperor along with his son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica
                        (Rebecca Ferguson), his wife and member of the Bene Gesserit Order. It will then be when the
                        Atreides family runs a great risk by being in the crosshairs of evil forces such as those of
                        their enemy Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), an ambitious and implacable governor
                        whose greatest desire is to end the Atreides at all costs. They will soon find themselves
                        involved in a plot of betrayal and deception that will lead them to question their trust among
                        those closest to them and to value the locals, the Fremen, a lineage of desert inhabitants with
                        a close relationship with spice.</p>
